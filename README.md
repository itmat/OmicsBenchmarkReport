# OmicsBenchmarkReport
Report template for omics methods benchmarking

This XLSX file provides a template for reporting on benchmarking studies that compare omics methods.
It consists of eleven sheets, each with brief instructions and areas to be filled out by the benchmarker.

The aims of completing this benchmark are to identify aspects of the benchmark that should be improved as well as to document any limitations that cannot be avoided.
Just as standard checklists and reports have improved research articles in areas such as requiring error bars on plots and reporting of sample sizes, we believe that this report can help to create more meaningful and understandable benchmarking.

This benchmark report developed was developed by the [ITMAT Bioinformatics Laboratory](http://bioinf.itmat.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine under Dr. Gregory Grant. We encourage its use, including the adaptation or modification to meet specific needs.
